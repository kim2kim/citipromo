<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Network with other DJ's and get tips to improve your events.</p>

<h3>Why should you join</h3>

Do you think you throw the best events out there.  Here's where you can put your words where your mouth is.  Show the world how great your events are by letting them tell you so.

Do you think your playlist is the shit?  Maybe your event isn't so great because your playlist isn't so great.  Find out from your guest what they think of your playlist.

How does our site work?  The more information you provide us, the better we are able to match you up with events in your area.  We only require an email to join.  All other information you provide is for us to help you find the best venue for your enjoyment or your source of business.  We do not spam your email.  We do however send you a reminder to visit us in case you forget about us.  This only happens twice a month.

Find your allies and join forces to create a mega event.    Let us help you be even greater than you are now.  What do you have to lose?

Are you new to the city.  We can help you find events in your area, even find you a group to go with.
